# Malware detection by system call graph using Machine Learning  #

Use a system call dependency graph to detect malware and analyze their behavior. The system calls are extracted and collected by Fredrickson and et al.[1]. It contains two sets of benchmarks: the malware and the regular software set. The malware set comprises 2631 samples pre-classified into 48 families and 11 types. The regular software set comprises 35 samples. A dependency graph is built from these system calls and a set of features for each software is extracted to specify the software behavior. A feature selection method is implemented to reduce the number of features by clustering them. Machine learning algorithms such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks are exploited to build two prediction models. The first model is a two-class model that classifies software into malware and regular software. The second model is a multi-class model, which identifies the type of malware, in addition to classifying the software to malware and regular software.
